# Serato sync crates

This is a tool that synchronizes your [Serato DJ Pro](https://serato.com/dj/pro)
crates with a folder in your file system. This comes in handy when you want to
organize your crates outside of Serato, but don't want to use iTunes to do it.

This program has been tested with Serato DJ Pro 1.8.1 and Serato DJ Pro 2.5.1
so it will most likely work with other versions as well.

## How to use

Download the latest version of the executable from
[the Releases page](https://github.com/svenheden/serato-sync-crates/releases),
open up a terminal and run it with the path to your music folder provided as the
first argument and the path to your Serato folder as the second argument, e.g.:

```
serato-sync-crates "/Users/svenheden/Music Library" "/Users/svenheden/Music/_Serato_"
```
